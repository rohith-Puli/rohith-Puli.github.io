Summary: Link to My first Musical Composition

My first original composition titled "Marugelara in Electronic Rock" is inspired from the Carnatic Classical composition "Marugelara" by the legened Swami Tyagaraja. The singer expresses his deep desire to find God (Raghava or Lord Rama) and become one with him.

I made all the tracks using Garage Band on an iPad!

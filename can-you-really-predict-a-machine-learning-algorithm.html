<h3>Recent reports by a research firm that a machine learning algorithm built for banking services was biased against African-American loan-seekers brings into light the problem that Machine  Learning faces today: We do not know exactly how a machine has taken its decision to account for that decision. If a machine's algorithm fails somewhere , resulting in the bank going bankrupt, who should we blame: the machine for its decisions or the bank for employing the machine?</h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Clearly, we are not at a point in the technological spectrum where laws that govern these issues exit. I do not however concede to the arguement that since Artificial Intelligence is still evolving and is not prevelant,  it only makes sense that laws have not been formed to address potential problems. It is precisely the problem that I advocate should be tackled. Policy frameworks governing the extent and accountability of these computer manufactured decisions should come into force even before the technology comes into the market.</h3>
<h2></h2>
<h3>Unfortunately, progress has been dead slow to address concerns like these through the judicial system. There are is no overarching law that keep in check biased algorithms, no policies that restrict developers from building biased algorithms. Forget about laws, there are no parameters that quantify or even identify the bias. A binding legal framework addressing these issues will make sure that advances in the field are cleansed of ulterior motives or unforeseen circumstances. Of course, these policies will take time, but I'm only unhappy with the effort by the global community in this direction.</h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>By voicing this opinion, I am NOT going against artificial intelligence. The prospects of the field are spectacular. The beauty lies in the machine taking decisions without human help. But there should be accountability and transperency in such decision making. A poor farmer who applied for a loan should exactly know why he was denied. Instances of denial should be case specific, not generic (One possible reason for the denial by a private bank's machine algorithm could be the farmer's financial instability, but not be that he comes under the category of 'farmer' in the training set).</h3>
<h3>The only reason why we trust technology is that we know it is reducible to equations. Once the common man looses this trust, we have lost the potential in artificial intellingce.</h3>
